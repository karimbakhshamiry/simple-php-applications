# simple-php-applications
In this project I wrote code to create a multiplication table, a simple calculator and a rectangle generator using php

1. The multiplication file prints the multiplication table for 1 to 9.
2. The rectangle file takes two input width and height. Then as soon as you press the submit button, it will generate a rectangle with the provided width and height.
3. the calculator takes three input, first digit, mathematical operation and second degit. As soon as you press show result button, it will show the result.
